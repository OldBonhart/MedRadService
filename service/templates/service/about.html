  <div class="card-body">
    <p class="card-text text-center"><td>Here, in MedRadIndustries, we specialize in developing and producing advanced technologies for predicting the pathogenesis of pneumonia, and we strive to highlight, working with clients, the creation of progressive, forward-looking, non-standard add-ons that fit specific tasks and needs. We are proud to support our creative independence in a rapidly declining  and highly competitive market.<td></td></p>
    <p><td>To ensure our uniqueness, we maintain an in-house staff of doctors and nurses, in addition to the usual array of augmentation scientists and researchers, training them to work with clients to determine individual needs. Med Ai Industries offers its clients free comprehensive, pre-operational screenings so as to better understand their personal challenges.</td></p>

    <h2 class="font-weight-bold card-title text-center mt-4 mb-2" style="color: white;">About <a style="color: #00FFF1;">Med Rad Industries</a></h2>

    <p>For prediction, we use a neural network with the ResNet architecture, trained on the <strong><a style="color: #00fbae;"> X-Ray </a> Dataset of the National Institute of Health Chest</strong></p>
    <p>This NIH Chest X-ray Dataset is comprised of 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients. To create these labels, the authors used Natural Language Processing to text-mine disease classifications from the associated radiological reports.</p>
    <p>We also created a convenient panel for visualizing explanations from our neural network using gradient localization [<a style="color: white;" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391"><strong>Grad-CAM</strong></a>], so that the radiologist can examine the prediction in detail.</p>

    <h2 class="font-weight-bold card-title text-center mt-4 mb-4" style="color: white;">Visualization of metrics</h2>
    <p>Our prediction algorithm has revolutionary accuracy, below is a graph of the following metrics:</p>
